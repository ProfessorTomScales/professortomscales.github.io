<h1>In short:</h1> 
<p>For doing discussion posting, I am looking for more than a simple "I agree" or a 1-2 sentence reply.
<br>The point of the topics is to get you to think deeper about the issues and how they are impacting your life. 
<br>I am looking for a well-thought-out paragraph response.
</p>
<br>

<h1>General Guidelines:</h1>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Do not assume you know what the topic's subject is about - Read about it first.</li>
<li>Use proper grammar and spelling.</li>
</p>
</ol>
<br>

<h1>Critical Thinking Tips:</h1>
<p>As a general guideline for these (or any critical thinking you do) think about these when writing your response:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clarity – are you making your point?</li>
<li>Accuracy – is what you are saying actually true?</li>
<li>Precision – are you being too vague?</li>
<li>Relevance – is what you are saying truly related to the topic?</li>
<li>Depth – are you going into any detail?</li>
<li>Breadth – have you considered multiple viewpoints?</li>
<li>Logic – does your argument/writing make sense?</li>
</p>
</ol>
