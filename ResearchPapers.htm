<h1>In short:</h1> 
<p>It is about research. You find information about the topic, read it until you have an understanding of the topic, and then you write about it using your own words. If you aren't comfortable enough with the subject to write about it on your own, then you haven't done enough research.
</p>

<h1>Sources:</h1>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Use credible sources - sources that can be trusted. Government & business web sites are good. Academic journals are good. The Wall Street Journal, CNN, and MSNBC are good.</li>
<li>Do not use your textbook or Webster's dictionary. The info they give will be too basic - that is just a cheap way to increase the number of sources you used.</li>
<li>Do not use a website from a person/institution that you have not heard of - unless you read up on them to ensure they know what they are talking about. If the person running the website is not an acknowledged expert on the subject, do not use them.</li>
<li>Do not use Wikipedia as a source for the same reason - you do not know who has updated the page last. You can use it as a starting point to get you a general idea of the topic, and some sources that you can check. Go directly to their sources to get the full picture, and then site that source.</li>
</p>
</ol>


<h1>Your own words:</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>It is your paper about a topic that you have learned about. It should be in your words. Do not cut-and-paste other sources. This is plagiarizing. copying someone else's words and then changing a few of them is still plagiarizing. Plagiarizing is stealing - In the real world you are violating copyright laws, opening yourself up for lawsuits (depending on what you do with your plagiarized material) and other mess. In college, it can cause you to fail your class or even to be kicked out of school.</li>
<li>The only time you should use a quote is when someone has stated the point so well/short that there is no way to say it better or shorter. In this case, use quotation marks & cite the source.</li>
<li>Cite any & every fact you use. Especially if it is something that you did not know before you started researching for your paper. This way, the reader can verify the fact, or if it is incorrect, you have passed the blame onto the person from whom the information came from. Citations are a means for you to CYA (Cover Your Assets) in case of errors.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>Other stuff:</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a logical flow of information. A very basic outline takes 2 minutes, but can help a lot.</li>
<li>Do not ask questions, and then not answer them.</li>
<li>Do not use "I" in the paper - the paper is about the subject, not you. (unless you are a world-recognized expert in the subject)</li>
<li>Do not bring up issues in your opening or closing that you do not cover in the paper.</li>
<li>Do not have sources in your bibliography that you did not use - if you use it, cite it. If not, leave it out.</li>
<li>Remember - cite sources of facts as well as quotes.</li>
</ol>
