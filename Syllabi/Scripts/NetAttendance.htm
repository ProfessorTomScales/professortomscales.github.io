<h1>Attendance & Participation</h1>
<p>
Attendance is based on how often you complete assignments, not how often you log in. If you go more than 2 weeks in a row without submitting any work, you may be dropped from the class.
<p>
Your participation comes from your activity in the discussion forums. This is the equivalent to "class discussion" in a seated class. Your discussions are graded on quality as well as quantity. Merely posting “I agree” or “yes, that’s a problem” will not be acceptable. I am looking for well-thought-out paragraphs. Rewording other people's posts is plagiarizing, and you will get a zero.
