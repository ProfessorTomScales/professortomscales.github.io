<h1>Behavior</h1>
<p>
Disruptive behavior is not allowed. If you are distracting other students, you will be asked to leave the class and you will be counted absent.
<p>
You are expected to show respect to your fellow classmates. Be polite in your conversations, discussion posts or emails to me or other students. Keep the level of conversation at PG-13. Avoid R-rated or X-rated language or content. 
<p>
I reserve the right to ban the use of Laptop computers, tablets, etc. if they become a distraction. 
<p>
Cell phones are not to be used in class. If you must have a phone on during class, have it on “vibrate”. Do not answer the phone in the classroom – if you absolutely need to, you can sneak out to return the call.
