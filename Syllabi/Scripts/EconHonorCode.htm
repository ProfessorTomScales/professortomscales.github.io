<h1>Honor Code</h1>
<p>
Assignments in this class are to be individual work, not collaborative efforts. Any cheating or shared work will result in zeros for the assignment. If you are caught cheating a second time, you will be dropped from the class and your semester grade will be an F.

<p>
Plagiarism is cheating and will result in a zero on the assignment. There is zero tolerance on this point, and no makeup or second chances will be given. Look in Blackboard or my website (above) for information about how to avoid plagiarism.
