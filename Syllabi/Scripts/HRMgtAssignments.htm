<h1>Assignments</h1>
<p>
There will be 4 Quizzes, each equally weighted. These will be done through Blackboard. You will have to complete the quiz on the designated day – you can choose the time of day that you take it. They will be timed – you will have 30 minutes from the time you begin to complete each quiz, so be sure you are in a quiet place where you will not be interrupted. Make-up quizzes will not be allowed. Each quiz will cover the previous 3 chapters.
<p>
There will be a cumulative final exam during exam week, in class. 50% of the questions will come from the final 4 chapters, and 50% will come from the first 11 chapters.
<p>
There will be weekly exercises to be completed in Blackboard. These may include questionnaires, Discussion Board posts, etc. They must be completed by the posted due date. They will usually be due before the following class meeting, but some will be due earlier so I can compile the results for use in class discussions. I will drop the lowest exercise grades. I will not allow these exercises to be made up since they will be discussed in class (and since you can drop 1).
<p>
Some chapters have cases we will discuss in class. Be sure to look over the cases as directed by the instructor, so you will be able to discuss them when the time comes.
<p>
The class participation grade will be computed based on the input you give in class discussions. Most people in the class have either supervised others, or had a supervisor, and this experience can be valuable for others to learn from. Obviously, it is hard to participate in class discussions if you are not present for class.
