<h1>Attendance & Participation</h1>
<p>
Regular attendance is expected, but attendance does not count as a specific portion of the grade. You are only allowed 2 absences for the semester. You will be counted as tardy for coming in late or leaving early. 2 tardies will be counted as 1 absence. Once you have your 2 absences you will be dismissed from the course.
<p>
Success in any class comes from attending class, participating, and practicing (doing the work). Other methods, such as osmosis, voodoo, and last minute cramming rarely work.  It is important that you attend class and complete all the reading before class.  Also, I do not expect you to sit quietly and stare at me the entire time. You are taking this class because you need it, so make the most of it by participating, asking questions, etc. College, like life, is what you make of it.
