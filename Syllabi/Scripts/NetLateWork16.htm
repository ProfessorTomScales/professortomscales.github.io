<h1>Late Work</h1>
<p>
The research paper is the only assignment that will be accepted late. You only have a 3 day grace period for turning in the paper late, and a minimum of 10 points will be taken off. After the 3 day grace period, no papers will be accepted, and your grade will be a zero - No exceptions!
<p>
I do not allow Chapter questions to be completed late, because the assignment schedule is suitably flexible. You are given 2 weeks to complete each chapter, so manage your time wisely, especially if you have travel plans.
<p>
I do not allow Discussions to be made up. Each discussion is the "topic of the week" and the point of the discussions is to get different people's perspectives on the topics, and to respond to each other. Once the week is over, the conversation has moved on, and if you were to email me a response, no one will benefit, and that defeats the purpose. When a discussion is finished, the question is locked out & no more posts are allowed. I will re-enable them for reviewing after they have been graded. Also, there is scheduling flexibility for discussions, since you do not have to reply to every topic - you are allowed to skip a few each semester.
