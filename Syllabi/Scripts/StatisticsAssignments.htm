<h1>Assignments</h1>
<p>
There will be <b>4 tests</b>, each equally weighted. 
<p>
There is a lock-out on test days. No one will be admitted into the room after 10 minutes. This is to minimize the distractions to other students, and to ensure fairness in test-taking.
<p>
I generally grade the tests as they are turned in. You are welcome to wait quietly at your desk for me to grade your test. Otherwise you are free to quietly leave the room. No talking will be allowed during the tests, even if you are finished.
<p>
Cell phones & iPods cannot be used as calculators on tests.
