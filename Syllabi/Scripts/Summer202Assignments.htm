<h1>Assignments</h1>
<p>
There will be chapter questions posted for you to answer after reading the chapter. You can use the book to complete these questions. They will be graded as quizzes, and averaged together. There are 12 chapters' questions to complete. The questions will show up in 2 batches of six chapters at a time. You will have 5 weeks to work the first 6 chapters, and then 5 weeks to do the last 6. I drop the lowest grade. I strongly suggest that you print the questions early on, so you can complete the work regardless of what may be happening with your internet connection. This way, even if something weird happens at the last minute, you can always find another computer & put in your answers.
<p>
Each Monday morning a new discussion question will be posted on the Discussion Board of Blackboard. You will be required to post a comment to 7 of these questions throughout the semester. I will be grading you on how thought-out your responses are. Merely posting “I agree” or “yes, that’s a problem” will not be acceptable. I am looking for well-thought-out paragraphs. You may respond to more than 7 of the topics – each additional response can add 1 extra point to your Discussion Board grade.
<p>
Each student must write a 4-5 page typed & double-spaced research paper. The papers must adhere to MLA or APA standards, using proper formatting, citations within the body of the paper, and a bibliography, the way you did your research papers in English 111 & 112. This paper is to be your writing, not a cut-and-paste project. Use a 12 pt. font and 1" margins. There is more information in Blackboard under “Assignments.” The papers will be submitted using “SafeAssign” a plagiarism-checking service in Blackboard.
<p>
In case of internet or Blackboard failures, work can be emailed to me. If you are having computer problems that will keep you from meeting a deadline, either email me (before the due date) or leave me a voicemail so arrangements can be made.
<p>
There is a “class policy quiz” that must be completed the first week of class. This “quiz” is a “contract” where you read & agree to follow the rules of the class. If you do not complete the quiz on time with a score of 100, you will be dropped from the class!
