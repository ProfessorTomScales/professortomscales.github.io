<h1>Required Materials</h1>
This class has no text. You will need to have some mobile tablet device. If you are not sure that what you have is adequate, check with me.
<p>
You must be prepared to purchase a few apps over the course of the semester. I encourage you to get an iTunes or Google Play gift card for this purpose. $20 should be more than sufficient.
