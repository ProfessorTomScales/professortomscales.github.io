<h1>Attendance & Participation</h1>
<p>
Regular attendance is expected, but attendance does not count as a specific portion of the grade. You are only allowed 2 absences for the semester. You will be counted as tardy for coming in late or leaving early. 2 tardies will be counted as 1 absence. Once you have your 2 absences you will be dismissed from the course.
<p>
As stated above, the goal of this class is to introduce you to the many ways mobile computing can enhance your personal life, student life, and your business capability. As the trend toward mobile computing continues, these skills will become even more important to your future businesses and careers. This class, college in general, and life itself is all about what you make of it. As such, you should actively listen and participate in all discussions and projects in class. Simply staring at me or your fellow students will limit what you will get out of this class. Also, you may have experienced issues that other people can learn from, or you may be using similar or different hardware from what others are using - and there is a lot to learn from those differences, too.
