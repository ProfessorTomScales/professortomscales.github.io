<p>
There will be several app reviews that you will post in Blackboard and the class Google+ Community. As the semester goes on, the requirements for the reviews will escalate to include screenshots, etc. These will be done outside of class, as part of the “online” portion of this hybrid class.
<p>
You will have to present three of your reviews as live in-class demonstrations, where you display the capability of the app, its strengths and weaknesses, and possibilities for use in business. The reviews will be written & posted outside of class, and any visuals you need must for your demonstration must also be prepared before class.
<p>
You will have a real-world project developing a plan to use apps and mobile devices to perform a task in your field of study. In this project you will have to write a paper outlining the particular problem you wish to solve or issue you wish to address, what apps and hardware you use to solve the problem, and a guide for readers to follow along so they, too can achieve the same goals using your method. You will also include a section outlining ways in which you think the process could be improved by future app or hardware enhancements. You will present your project in class during the final class meeting.
