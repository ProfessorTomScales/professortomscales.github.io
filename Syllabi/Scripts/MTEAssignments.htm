<h1>Assignments</h1>
<p>
Each MTE section has between 1 and 4 chapters of work. Your goal is to successfully pass either the Pre-test or Post-Test for each of the assigned chapters with a grade of 75%. Once you pass the test for a chapter you will be able to move on to the next chapter. There are homework questions for each chapter section to help you learn and practice - you must get 75% of them correct before the next homework section will unlock. Once you have passed all the chapters for your class you are finished for the section (although working ahead is <i>highly</i> encouraged.
<p>
There are "show me a similar problem" tutorials, "Help me solve this" tutorials, an electronic version of the textbook, and online videos within the course materials to help you learn. Of course, you can always ask me for help too!
<p>
The syllabus will tell you which chapters you are to complete, and has a schedule for you to follow to ensure you do not fall behind. You can work on your math outside of class, and you <i>should</i> if you find yourself behind schedule.
