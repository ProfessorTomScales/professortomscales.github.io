<h1>Late Work & Makeup Work</h1>
<p>
The Late work and make-up tests will be allowed <b><i>only</i></b> if arrangements are made <b><i>in advance.</i></b> Only 1 attempt to make up an assignment will be allowed, and the assignment must be completed before the next class meeting. If you fail to meet the make-up deadline, the grade will be a zero.
<p>
It is your responsibility to come to me if you are going to miss an assignment, in order to work out a make-up arrangement.
<p>
Failure to complete 3 assignments will also lead to you being dismissed from the course.
