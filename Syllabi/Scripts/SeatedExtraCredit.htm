<h1>Extra Credit</h1>
<p>
You have the opportunity to get extra points at various points throughout the semester.<br><br>

I <b>do not</b> give out-of-class extra credit projects. The reasons:<br>
<ol>
<li>Your grade is based on your mastery of 16 weeks of material. If you did not absorb the material in those 16 weeks, there is no assignment you can do in one week that will give you the 16 week's learning. If there was, that is all we would do for the semester.</li>
<li>Offering extra assignments to someone is not fair to all the other students in the class.</li>
<li>You would be asking me to do extra work to make up for your miscue, which is not fair to me, either.</li>
</ol>
