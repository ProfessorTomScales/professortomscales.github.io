<h1>Extra Credit</h1>
<p>
You have the opportunity to get extra points by replying to additional discussion topics. There is a minimum that you must reply to, and each extra post can earn you 1 extra point added to your discussion grade.<br><br>

I <b>do not</b> give out-of-class extra credit projects. The reasons:<br>
<ol>
<li>Your grade is based on your mastery of 16 weeks of material, (crammed into 8 weeks). If you did not absorb the material in those 8 weeks, there is no assignment you can do in one week that will give you the 16 week's learning. If there was, that is all we would do for the semester.</li>
<li>Offering extra assignments to someone is not fair to all the other students in the class.</li>
<li>You would be asking me to do extra work to make up for your miscue, which is not fair to me, either.</li>
</ol>
